# 2D-Car-Racing-Game-in-Python
A 2D car racing game developed using Python. Designed as a fun, interactive project, the game allows players to control a car on a scrolling track, avoiding obstacles and aiming for the highest possible score. This project is ideal for showcasing skills in basic game development, 2D graphics handling, and event-driven programming.Features:
 • Smooth Controls: Intuitive car handling that lets players maneuver the vehicle with ease.
 • Obstacle Avoidance: Randomly generated obstacles appear on the track, requiring quick reflexes to avoid collisions.
 • Score System: A scoring mechanism that tracks the player’s progress based on distance and successful avoidance of obstacles.
 • Simple Graphics and Sound: Basic visuals and sound effects that enhance the retro arcade feel of the game.

Technology Stack:
 • Language: Python
 • Library: Pygame

Purpose:
This project serves as an excellent introduction to game development, demonstrating foundational concepts like sprite movement, collision detection, and game loops in Pygame.
